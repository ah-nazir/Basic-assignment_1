    <h2><u>Chocolate</u></h2>
    <p>Chocolate is another one of my favorite foods. It's a sweet treat that comes in many different forms and flavors, from milk chocolate to dark chocolate. I especially love eating chocolate when I'm feeling down or need a little pick-me-up.</p>
    
    <h2><u>Ice Cream</u></h2>
    <p>For dessert, nothing beats a cold scoop of ice cream. Whether it's vanilla or chocolate, I love indulging in this sweet treat on a hot day.</p>
